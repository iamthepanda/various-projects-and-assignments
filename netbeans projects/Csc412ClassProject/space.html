                    <h1>Science Fiction</h1>

                    <div class="well">
                        <p>I am, and always have been, a Sci-Fi geek.</p>
                        <p>It started at a young age when my mom brought home a VHS set of the Star Wars Trilogy. I would sit in front of the TV for hours and just have Star Wars marathons constantly.</p>
                        <p>Later on my mom brought home a movie called Stargate. Again, I would watch this movie tirelessly. Not long after, I discovered there was a TV show called Stargate SG1, which I fell in love with. There has yet to be a show which surpasses it. I waited every week for each new episode and would watch every rerun that aired. I also watched every episode of every spinoff of the show. I was a bit obsessed. The wonder, the action, the adventure, discovery, excitement. I loved it all. This show solidified my love for the Science Fiction Genre.</p>
                        <p>The only book series I have finished entirely is the Ender's Game series. I liked how every sequel was completely different from the book that came before it. The Shadow series, which is an offshoot of the Ender series was also excellent. Though I technically read the entire series at the time, the author, Orson Scott Card, has come out with a couple more books from the two series since I had completed it. So I have some more reading to do before I can keep saying I have read the entire series.</p>
                        <p>None of my friends in grade school never really knew how much I was into Sci-Fi. I never really got close enough to anybody to share this information though. Anyways, if you are still reading this then you know more about me than 99% of the people I know. Any wow you really read this whole thing??</p>
